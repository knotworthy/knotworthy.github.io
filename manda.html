		<h1>AMANDA NUR RAHMA ARIEF</h1>

		<p> Kuromi (クロミ, Kuromi) is a character from the My Melody universe. She is My Melody's rival and doppelgänger, and manifests as a white rabbit or imp-like creature wearing a black jester's hat with a pink skull on the front and a black devil's tail. The skull's facial expression on her forehead changes to match Kuromi's mood. Fittingly, her birthday is on Halloween (October 31st). Her name translates from Japanese to English as "black beauty" </p>
		<p> Her mother and father wears a very similar outfit as herself. Kuromi makes her first appearance in 2005 as an antagonist of Onegai My Melody and is intended to be a mischievous, dark counterpart to My Melody, though in later current series such as Hello Kitty and Friends Supercute Adventures, her role is now changed into a more friendly demeanor with Hello Kitty and her friends, including My Melody herself </p>
		<p> Like most other Sanrio characters, <i>Kuromi's</i> <em><strong>appearance is inspired by those of cartoon/anime characters from the early 20th century, as well as the 1990s, specifically Impmon from the Digimon series or Pichu from Nintendo's Pokemon franchise.</strong></em> On her debut, Kuromi took the punk, scene, and goth communities by storm and quickly became highly successful due to her unique, contrasting yet similar appearance and "naughty" personality compared to My Melody (which explains her trademark "angry" eyes), and due to this immense popularity, she since become a major character for Sanrio. True to her rivalry, Kuromi even sometimes surpasses My Melody herself in official Sanrio rankings and official media often has her directly competing against her counterpart. </p>

		<h2> What is Kuromi's Personality? </h2>
		<h4> Although Kuromi may look and act tough and punk, she is actually very girly and is attracted to good-looking guys! Kuromi enjoys writing in her diary and is hooked on romantic short stories. Her favorite colors are black and hot pink. Her favorite food is shallots, all kinds of meat, and in recent Kuromi merchandise, cherries have been shown. Despite being a villain (in Onegai My Melody), Kuromi is mostly into food and even cooks. You might call her a rowdy free spirit. </h4>

		<h5> Kuromi is rebellious, mischievous, and free-spirited at her core, <a href="#">though she does has a soft spot for good-looking boys like Keiichi Hiiragi and Prince Sorara.</a> Her blind-sightedness when she is romantically interested in someone allows her more delicate personality to shine through her tough exterior. In most situations, she is extremely prone to aggression and is frequently shown to be abusive towards Baku. She is naturally protective of her accomplice Baku, and her friends Nyanmi, Wanmi, Konmi, and Chumi. Throughout the series, Kuromi takes on risks for them to ensure their safety. Although she dislikes My Melody, she does seem to care about her to some extent. </h5>
